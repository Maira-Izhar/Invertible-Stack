# Invertible-Stack
This C++ code uses Stack data structure to implement invertible stack functionality. The problem is solved in O(1) time complexity using a bool variable to flip stack such that the elements are pushed/popped from opposite side.
# Compiler
This code is built and tested on Visual Studio 2022.
